> For battery charging thresholds I recently dug into that a bit and got the following guidance from the battery team:
> – If you often discharge your battery to near eempty (< 20%) then start charging at 95% and stop at 100%
> – If you frequently use the battery but don't fully discharge. Usage between 50% and 100% then start charging at 75% and stop at 80%
> – If you always use an AC adapter and rarely use battery start charging at 45% and stop at 50%


```bash
sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw

# for Thinkpads
tlp-stat -b #suggest which additional package to install

# bluetooth off at startup:

DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP="bluetooth"

# Akku-Ladeschwellen vorübergehend auf Maximum setzen
sudo tlp fullcharge [ BAT0 | BAT1 ]

# Akku einmalig bis zur oberen Schwelle laden

```


## Tools

### PDF

#### Extracting photos from multiple PDFs using pdfunite and pdfimages

```bash
pdfunite *.pdf allphotos.pdf

pdfimages -j ‘allphotos.pdf’ image
```


## Troubleshooting

### Error: *Can't format USB storage*

I got this fixed by doing the following

Type disks and launch the program,
select the disk or drive you want to format,
press CTRL+F and click format.

After formatting, the disk or drive would be unallocated, therefore you'll have to create a partition by using the plus button on the screen.. Then insert the name you'll like to use as the drive or disk name then click on create. Enjoy....
