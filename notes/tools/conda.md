# Conda

[Conda](https://conda.io) is a package manager and environment management system.

```

### Miniconda

```bash
# Download

# Activate
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Should you add Conda to the PATH?

#### Prevent conda from activating the base env by default

- [Stackoverflow Thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54429210/how-do-i-prevent-conda-from-activating-the-base-environment-by-default)

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```


### Want to change kernel in jupyter?

Base environment needs the `nb_conda_kernels` package.
Every environment needs the ipykernel package.

```bash
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```


## Updating Conda

### Update base environment

```
conda update conda
```

### Update all packages of activated environment

```
conda update --all
```


## Environments

### Create new environment and switch to it

```bash
conda create -n name_of_new_env
conda activate name_of_new_env
```

Create environment with specific python version:

```bash
conda create -n name_of_new_env python=3.12
```

### Remove environment

```bash
conda remove -n name_of_env --all
# alternative: conda env remove -n name_of_env
```

### List all environments

```bash
conda env list
```

### Adding channels to environment

Activate the environment, then:

```bash
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
```

### Sharing an environment

This can be useful if you want to document the package versions for a project or if you are collaborating with other people so they can work with the same environment.

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

To exclude packages that were installed into the environment as a dependency add the flag `--from-history`.
This can help for cross-platform compatibility, because *conda* will figure out platform-specific dependencies.
However, this will not document the version of a package if the version was not explicitly stated when installing.

```bash
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
```

To recreate the environment using the *yml* file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


## Archived

### Deep learning environment

Prereq:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev # for saving keras models efficiently

sudo apt install graphviz
```

```bash
conda create -n deeplearn
source activate deeplearn

conda install tensorflow-gpu

conda install matplotlib
conda install opencv # needed for some examples
conda install pydot # graphviz
conda install pillow # python imaging library

conda install cython # Why?

conda install ipykernel # for kernel selection in jupyter

# conda install matplotlib PyYAML opencv-python pydot pillow cython
```

### Check tensorflow gpu

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.test.is_gpu_available(
    cuda_only=False,
    min_cuda_compute_capability=None
)
```
