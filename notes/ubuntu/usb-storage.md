# USB storage


## Mount

`sudo mount -o remount,rw /media/<storage-name>`

## Error: *Can't format USB storage*

I got this fixed by doing the following

Type disks and launch the program,
select the disk or drive you want to format,
press CTRL+F and click format.

After formatting, the disk or drive would be unallocated, therefore you'll have to create a partition by using the plus button on the screen.. Then insert the name you'll like to use as the drive or disk name then click on create. Enjoy....
